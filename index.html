        You know he's a man of the people because it looks just like everyone else's house. If he wins the presidency
        he is gonna invite everyone over. Of course there will be a wall though, just
        to prevent "unwanted" guests.

    <div id="rightcolumn">

      <p><span style="font-size: larger; font-weight: bold; color: red;">Donald <span id="tmoney">$TMONEY</span> is running for President of the United States and wants you to send $TMONEY to raydium. But he
        Here's some reasons to elect him:</p>
      <p> <small>
          <UL>
            <LI><img src="images/grandma.jpg" alt="A picture of a grandma with swastika cookies" height="150"
                width="125" />He understands how
              frustrating it is for your grandma to call other countries for customer service.
              Accents are hard and who has time for human decency? Trump understands this because most of his products
              are
              actually made in other countries. He's gonna make sure to bring those jobs make to America though. You can
              believe him, really.
              <p>
                <p />
            <LI> <img src="images/sign.jpg" alt="A cartoon of homophobes" height="150" width="211" /> He knows what your
              parents needs and its to make sure they never have to see two men or two women in love. Obviously
              LGBT people are icky so there's no reason to let them get married. He'll do his best to make sure they
              don't even have
              basic human rights! What a guy!
              <p>
                <p />
            <LI> <img src="images/hip.jpg" alt="A picture of a young Trump supporter with Purple Hair" height="150"
                width="112" /> Most importantly
              he understands your needs.
              <span class="blink"><b>Look at this cool website!!!</b></span> He just wants to be your bae.
              Just like how your grandparents paid for their children's education, he's gonna make sure your parents pay
              for yours.
              After all, you're white and money isn't an issue. Why should you bother helping other people? They only
              have themselves
              to blame for being poor.
              <p>
                <p />
            <LI> Last of all, Donald TMONEY is gonna make sure America stays great for generations to come. This country
              was founded by white people, because obviously Native Americans don't count. White immigrants 100 years
              ago were
              okay because all of them were good people who never did anything bad like commit mass genocide. We all
              know that
              immigrants of today are horrible rapists and murderers and drug dealers. It's clear that these people
              aren't coming
              to our country for a better life. They are all liars. That's why I'm gonna build a giant wall. America
              will stay
              <del> white</del> great, for generations to come.

      <p>If you've started to get a headache from the stupidity, racism, homophobia, and/or xenophobia in these
        comments, well
        take a break and forget all that with some <a href="https://www.pump.fun/">
          mother fucking $TMONEY</a>.</p>
